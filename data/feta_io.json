  "shortDescription": "Feta streamlines the meeting process for product and engineering teams by integrating tasks and discussions into a single, manageable workflow. It reduces pre-meeting preparation by syncing tasks from tools like GitHub and Jira into a Kanban view, and enhances post-meeting productivity by automatically updating project management tools with new tasks and comments. An example use case is a development team using Feta to organize daily stand-ups, where they can quickly review open tasks and PRs, discuss blockers, and plan their day effectively.",
