  "shortDescription": "Backlight is a comprehensive tool designed for front-end teams to create and manage design systems effectively. It caters to developers and is also appreciated by designers due to its integration capabilities, like the Figma plugin. Users can start from scratch or use existing templates to kick-start their design systems. An example use case includes a team rapidly developing a UI kit directly from code, ensuring consistency and speeding up the design process.",
